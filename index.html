			<p>I’ve seen and heard about you for years, but I’m happy to finally know you. I want to show you off to everyone I know. It’s so easy for me to share things with you, and you help me meet and connect with so many people. You never fail to keep track of what I’m doing and remind me of everything we’ve done together. </p><br>

			<p>
			You’re so easy to understand. I go to your website, and start a new <span class="c">repository</span>. I put the remote repository url into my project in git with the command <span class="c">git remote add origin url</span>. After that I type <span class="c">git push -u origin master</span>, and my changes upload on to your site, github! Anyone online can collaborate with my project, and you provide me with a great way to work with others and show off what I’ve done. </p><br><p>

			Our relationship is simple, which is why I wanted to tell you I love you.
			</p><br><p>
			Yours truly,</p><br><p>
			Ashley</p>
